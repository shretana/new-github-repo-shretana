# Explanation for Repository Settings
I used https://choosealicense.com/ to help me determine to use the MIT license. I chose it because it's description of being simple and permissive matched this assignment!
I decided to make the repo public since it seemed like the best option so everyone in class could see and reference it if needed.
I kept a Read.Me file because it seemed like the most common and helpful thing to do!
